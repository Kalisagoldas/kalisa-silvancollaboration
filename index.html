    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
    true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
    is false. An if statement looks as follows:

    <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
    condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
    Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
    condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
    statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
    including further nested if statements.
    <p>
      You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
      conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
    </p>
    <code
      >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
      } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
    </code>
    In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
    evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
    them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
    to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

    <code
      >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
      statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
      statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
      statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
    >
    It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
    because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
    the code. For example, do not use the following code:
    <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
    assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
    additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

    <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

  <header>while statement</header>

    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
    evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

    <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
    statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
    statement following the loop.

    <p>
      The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
      the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
      tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
      control is passed to the statement following while.
    </p>

    <p>
      To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
      those statements.
    </p>

    Example:

    <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

    <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
    <p>
      With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
      Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
      <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
      <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
      true, so the loop terminates.

    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
    statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

    <ul>
      <li>The name of the function.</li>
